# Brief Introduction:

In this project, I have created multithread server and client which enabled more than one
client to be able to connect in the server. When clients connected to server, they asked
what they want in series of questions and then with respect to the answer they have given,
the correct request is send to the server and server that that request, send it to Alpha
Vantage API and receive back the data. After receiving the data, server parse the data
properly to send the proper data to the client. Most crucial part about the project was to be
able to see the application layer protocols and implement correct behavior for correct
output behavior.
